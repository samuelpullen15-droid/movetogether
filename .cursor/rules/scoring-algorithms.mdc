## Activity Ring Scoring (85/100)
- Three-ring tracking system calculates daily progress:
  - Move: Percentage of calorie goal achieved (0-200%)
  - Exercise: Minutes of elevated heart rate (0-60 min)
  - Stand: Hours with activity detected (0-12 hrs)
- Multi-provider data normalization applies conversion factors:
  - Apple Health: Direct mapping
  - Fitbit: Custom calorie/step ratio
  - Garmin: Heart rate zone adjustments

## Competition Point Distribution (90/100)
- Daily score calculation:
  - Base points = (Move% + Exercise% + Stand%) / 3
  - Bonus multipliers:
    - Perfect day (all rings closed): 1.5x
    - Streak bonus: +0.1x per day (max 1.5x)
    - Underdog bonus: 1.2x if trailing by >20%
- Weekly/Monthly aggregation:
  - Running total of daily scores
  - Streak maintenance requires 85% ring closure
  - Tiebreaker uses highest single-day score

## Achievement Progress (80/100)
- Tiered medal system tracks milestones:
  - Bronze: Basic completion metrics
  - Silver: Consistency requirements
  - Gold: Excellence in multiple categories
  - Platinum: Long-term mastery goals
- Progress normalization:
  - Provider-specific activity data converted to standard units
  - Workout intensity calculated using MET values
  - Heart rate zones standardized across devices

## Streak Management (75/100)
- Active streak requirements:
  - Minimum 50% daily ring closure
  - Grace period: 1 missed day per week
  - Holiday exceptions on recognized dates
- Recovery mechanics:
  - 3-day buffer to maintain long streaks
  - Partial credit for multi-day competitions
  - Retroactive streak restoration with premium subscription
